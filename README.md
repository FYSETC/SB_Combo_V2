## Introduction:
 SB CAN V2 is a newly designed SB tool board running Klipper firmware. Based on STM32F072, it provides two communication modes: CANBUS and USB. The onboard USBHUB has up to three USB interfaces, which can be used to connect to the scanning leveling sensor (Scanner Leveling Sensor,such as IDM or Cartographer )and AI camera, etc. It can also be connected vertically with an optional board for easy use.

## Features:
